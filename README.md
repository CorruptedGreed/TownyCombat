    - Players with full Chainmail or heavier are extra slow at jumping/climbing.
    - This feature increases tactical options on the battlefield.
    - This feature allows nation to develop practically useful military uniforms.
      - A full diamond/netherite set is no longer de-rigeur, due to its tactical vulnerability (*ie. slow*).
      - Instead, each nations can develop its own practically useful uniform, with different materials and (with leather) colours. 
- :bust_in_silhouette: :footprints: **Tactical Invisibilty:** ***(Disabled By Default)***
  - Use stealth tactics by going invisible on the dynmap.
  - This is a harcore battle feature, which enables stealth tactics, in exchange for showing less activity on the dynmap.
  - There are 2 Modes:
    - Automatic: You go map-invisible when in the wilderness.
    - Triggered: You go map-invisible when holding a certain combination of items in your hands (*e.g. double diamond swords*).
