## Features:

  - Try it and see!
- :coffin: :moneybag: **Keep Stuff on Death:**
  - If you die within 400 blocks of a town-homeblock, you keep your inventory and levels.
  - Any tools/weapons/armour in your inventory are subject to a 20% degrade.
- :bust_in_silhouette: :footprints: **Tactical Invisibilty:** ***(Disabled By Default)***
  - Use stealth tactics by going invisible on the dynmap.
  - This is a harcore battle feature, which enables stealth tactics, in exchange for showing less activity on the dynmap.
  - There are 2 Modes:
    - Automatic: You go map-invisible when in the wilderness.
    - Triggered: You go map-invisible when holding a certain combination of items in your hands (*e.g. double diamond swords*).  
- :crossed_swords: :recycle: **Tactical Damage Adjustments** ***(upcoming in 0.2.0)***
  - Player weapon damage decreased by -30%.
- :arrow_right: :recycle: **Tactical Movement Adjustments** ***(upcoming in 0.2.0)***
  - Player walking speed increased by +10%.
  - Military Equipment reduces walking speeds:
    - Equipment:
      - Shield: -4 %
      - Full Leather Set: -4 %
      - Full Chainmail Set: -8 %
      - Full Iron Set: -16 %
      - Full Gold Set: -20 %
      - Full Diamond Set: -24 %    (*Walking around literally covered in rocks...*)
      - Full Netherite Set: -28 %
    - Players with 8% encumbrance or more are extra slow at jumping/climbing.
    - This feature increases tactical options on the battlefield.
    - This feature also allows nation to develop practically useful military uniforms.
      - Full diamond/netherite sets are no longer de-rigeur, due to their tactical vulnerability (*ie. reduced soldier speed*).
      - Instead, each nation can develop its own practically useful uniform, containing specific  materials and (with leather) colours.
